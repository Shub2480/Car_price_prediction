I built a car price predictor model using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm that combines the advantages of both tree-based and gradient-based approaches. The model takes in various features of a second-hand car, such as its make, model, year, mileage, engine displacement, fuel type, and location, and predicts its price with high accuracy.

To develop the model, I first performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, which included handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming categorical variables into numeric ones using one-hot encoding. Then, I split the data into training and testing sets and trained the XGBoost model using the training data with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

The resulting model achieved excellent performance on the test set. I also used feature importance analysis to identify the most significant factors influencing the car prices, which can help car sellers and buyers make more informed decisions.
